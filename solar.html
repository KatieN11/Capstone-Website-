        This is a worldwide radio jove campaing of citizen science to research
        any possible radio emission changes due to the total solar eclipse,
        which happened on April 8th across the Americas. As someone in the
        narrow beam of total elcipse, located in Ohio, I decided to join their
        citizen science campaign to study any possible effects on radio
        emission.

      <h3 class="title">Preparation</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        to prepare, Radio Jove members had a number of observing practice
        sessions, which included observations and zoom meetings. Additionally,
        to prepare we had to take out the phasing cable of our dipoles (so that
        they were pointed at the zenith), and take multiple data points before
        and after the eclipse to compare to eclipse data. the data is in the
        table below.

        1. Solar Flare noticed at the bottom of the eclipse during totality - wondering how that could impact solar readings from the telescope</p>
